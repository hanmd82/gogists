Command-line Flags
- Use command-line flags to manage configuration settings.

Leveled Logging
- Prefix informational messages with "INFO" and output to stdout.
- Prefix error messages with "ERROR" and output to stderr, along with the relevant file name and line number (for debugging).
    ```bash
    $ go run ./cmd/web >>/tmp/info.log 2>>/tmp/error.log
    ```
- By default, Goâ€™s HTTP server logs errors using the standard logger.
- Custom loggers created by `log.New()` are concurrency-safe.

Dependency Injection
- It is good practice to inject dependencies (e.g. database connection pool, centralized error handlers, template caches) into handlers.
- For applications where handlers are in the same package, a neat way to inject dependencies is to put them into a custom `application` struct, and then define handler functions as methods against `application`.
- If handlers are spread across multiple packages, create a `config` package exporting an `Application` struct, and have handler functions close over this to form a `closure`:
    ```go
    func main() {
        app := &config.Application{
            ErrorLog: log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
        }
        mux.Handle("/", handlers.Home(app))
    }

    func Home(app *config.Application) http.HandlerFunc {
        return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            ...
            if err != nil {
                app.ErrorLog.Println(err.Error())
                ...
            }
            ...
        }
    }
    ```
