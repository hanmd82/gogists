## Form Processing

Techniques
- Parse and access form data sent in a `POST` request
- Perform common validation checks on the form data
- Alert the user to validation failures and re-populate form fields with previously submitted data
- Scale-up validation and keep handlers clean by creating a form helper in a separate reusable package
